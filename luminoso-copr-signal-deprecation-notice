echo "After 4 years of maintaining this Copr repository, it is finally time to discontinue it for all Fedora releases."
echo ""
echo "There are 4 reasons for this decision:"
echo "1. This package violates Copr terms by shipping built-in FFmpeg libraries, and it is hard to modernize the spec that builds signal-desktop to make it Copr compliant."
echo "2. Modernizing it would mean duplicating network:im:signal efforts with no added value."
echo "3. There more than one alternative for this Copr for quite a long time."
echo "4. You can migrate without losing your data."

echo "Alternatives:"
echo "1. network:im:signal in Open Build Service (OBS) from OpenSuse provides a rpm release, in which the Fedora version is also built. It is superior to this Copr due to supporting doing a complete offline build (doesn't require any internet) and doesn't need the signal's prebuilt libraries anymore by recursively building all Signal's dependencies - https://build.opensuse.org/repositories/network:im:signal"
echo "2. The Flatpak release has proven to work as well (or even better) than this Copr"

echo "How to migrate your conversation data to flatpak:"
echo ""
echo "1. Install flatpak version from flathub: https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.signal.Signal"
echo "2. cp ~/.config/Signal ~/.var/app/org.signal.Signal/config/Signal"
